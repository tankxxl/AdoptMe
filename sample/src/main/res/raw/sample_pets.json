THIS IS A  WONDERFUL, GENTLE AND LOVING COMPANION WHO WILL APPRECIATE EVERY ACT OF KINDNESS SHE RECEIVES.  TERRIER SAVVY FAMILIES WITH AN EXCELLENT TRACK-RECORD OF VETERINARY CARE ARE ENCOURAGED TO APPLY.\n\nLILY IS LOCATED IN A PRIVATE FOSTER HOME IN PEORIA ILLINOIS (not Naperville).  WE WELCOME APPLICATIONS FROM OUTSIDE THE IMMEDIATE AREA AND PARTIAL TRANSPORT ASSISTANCE MAY BE AVAILABLE BUT ADOPTNG FAMILY MUST BE PREPARED TO DO SOME TRAVEL TOO.   \nIf you wish to apply to adopt Lily, you'll need to fill out our Adoption Application. To learn more about Cairn Rescue USA, please visit our website at www.cairnrescuieusa.com and please also review our FAQs.\n\n6 year old Lily is a beautiful, affectionate Toto look-a-like who loves to cuddle and receive attention. \n\nBefore coming into Cairn Rescue USA, Lily was a brood bitch in a breeding facility.  Like many breeder dogs who come from larger kennels, she lived in a cage with a concrete floor and never resided in a home.  Her exposure to humans was minimal and she was not socialized with toys or leashed walks as we expect to do with our pets. Simply put, she was used as livestock and her purpose in life was to produce puppies for profit. \n\nToday, Lily's life is quite different and she has grown by leaps and bounds.  She is  blossoming into a wonderful and happy young lady who responds to her name  and gives affectionate kisses.  \n\nLily's foster mom describes her as a girl with a great spirit!  She greatly enjoys the freedom of running in a fenced yard and playing with toys.  And for the first time in her 6 years she is sleeping on a soft bed and loves being pampered.\n\nLily is currently in a home with one other female Cairn who is ultra protective of her mom and demanding of attention so there have been a few altercations.  But Lily plays outside with a variety of visiting dogs and genuinely seems to enjoy canine companionship.   She would likely do very well with one other smaller, laid-back doggie pal.  She seems to do ok with cats.  too.   Lily CAN be food aggressive with other dogs, likely due to the fact that she had to fight for food in her previous life, so her future home will want to feed her separately from other household pets.\n\nAlthough still a bit wary of loud noises and unknown situations, Lily is curious about her new world and is very eager to please. She wags her tail all the time now and shows true delight in interaction with kind humans. This little dog who previously had so little, is grateful for every act of kindness. \n\nIn her past life as a breeder dog, Lily had no concept of when and where to go potty so when she came into our adoption program, house training started from the ground up.   But Lily has proven to be a fast learner and has made great strides in this area.  Today she rarely has pee accidents in the house and she holds it all night.  But pooping is still a work in progress so her future home will need to be patient and consistent as she fine-tunes her habits.  Warmer weather will certainly help her want to stay outside longer to finish the job.\n\nLily lies quietly in a crate but will not go in willingly. She much prefers being out and about with her people. At night she sleeps on a guest bed and would likely love to share a bed with her future parent.\n\nLIly would be a wonderful companion for a retired gal or a quieter retired couple or even a work-from-home dog parent.   But she does need a home where there is an adult family member home for the majority of the day so that she can receive the  the time, love and structure that she so deserves.  At this stage, Lily has no concept of leashed walks and she MUST have a securely fenced yard (sorry, no electric fencing).  A home with an older child might be considered but Lily is not appropriate for an active home with lots of noise and commotion. \n\nLily has been spayed and tested negative for heartworm disease. She is up-to-date on all her routine vaccination. She recently had a complete dental with seven extractions. Like many Cairns, she has some patella luxation and some stiffness in her legs but this in no way impedes her level of activity or her ability to run. Her future owner will want to keep her on a glucosamine/chondroitin supplement and monitor her weight to insure that she enjoys many more years of activity and health."},"sex":{"$t":"F"},"age":{"$t":"Adult"},"size":{"$t":"S"},"mix":{"$t":"no"},"shelterId":{"$t":"IL233"},"lastUpdate":{"$t":"2014-01-28T16:10:54Z"},"media":{"photos":{"photo":[{"@size":"x","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/US/IL/IL233/28405622/IL233.28405622-1-x.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"fpm","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/US/IL/IL233/28405622/IL233.28405622-1-fpm.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"pn","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/US/IL/IL233/28405622/IL233.28405622-1-pn.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"pnt","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/US/IL/IL233/28405622/IL233.28405622-1-pnt.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"t","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/US/IL/IL233/28405622/IL233.28405622-1-t.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"x","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/US/IL/IL233/28405622/IL233.28405622-2-x.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"fpm","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/US/IL/IL233/28405622/IL233.28405622-2-fpm.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"pn","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/US/IL/IL233/28405622/IL233.28405622-2-pn.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"pnt","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/US/IL/IL233/28405622/IL233.28405622-2-pnt.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"t","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/US/IL/IL233/28405622/IL233.28405622-2-t.jpg","@id":"2"}]}},"id":{"$t":"28405622"},"animal":{"$t":"Dog"}},{"options":{"option":[{"$t":"altered"},{"$t":"hasShots"},{"$t":"housebroken"}]},"breeds":{"breed":{"$t":"Beagle"}},"shelterPetId":{},"status":{"$t":"A"},"name":{"$t":"Milo"},"contact":{"email":{"$t":"waifsandstraysanimalrescue@comcast.net"},"zip":{"$t":"60565"},"city":{"$t":"Naperville"},"fax":{"$t":"630.420.2659"},"address1":{},"phone":{"$t":"630.615.8711 "},"state":{"$t":"IL"},"address2":{}},"description":{"$t":"Milo is a super sweet three year old purebred Beagle who is looking for a new home because his family lost theirs and could not keep him and his 6 year old Beagle brother D-O-G.

I am so sweet I am just like sugar! I just love attention and will follow you around waiting for you to pet me and will sit in your lap to get it too! I get along great with most dogs and cats and like kids too! I use to suffer aniety issues and have not been tested alone for a long time so we are not sure how I owuld do alone or as an only pup in the home. I would love to be adopted with my loving sister Sassy. I would probable need someone who is home for long periods of time if I am adopted alone. I am housebroken and can go a long time so if you work I would do well as long as I get to go potty before you go to work. I lived in a home with a yard and love it but I does love walks too! I am not your typical Beagle where I bark and howl all the time but if someone comes to the door I'll let you know I have company coming in to see me. . I really love my sister Sassy and feel safe and comfy with her and I am not afraid when left home so that is why we would love to be adopted together but I can be adopted alone. I am crate trained but I don't need to be crate trained if it is found I am okay alone.\n She has had two families in her life.. her first family had her since she was a puppy for 1.5yrs and we do not know why she was given up. Her next family adopted both her and Sassy from two seperate locations but they have lived together since then, the family ran into a personal issue and could no longer care for both dogs and asked for help. Ellie Mae is crate trained but does not need to be crated. \nEllie Mae is fully vetted, spayed, heartworm neg and microchipped.Otherwise Ellie Mae would need a home with someone home all day or with her sister and we are so low keyed we are perfect together! \nI am fully vetted/spayed/heartworm neg/microchipped\n Check out \"My Story\" for more information about me\n Ellie Mae and Sassy are both 5yr old sweet sweet girls looking for thier furever home together. Ellie Mae is a purebred Beagle has anxiety issues when alone and feels very comfy with her sister Sassy the Beagle/Dachshund around otherwise she would need a home with someone home all day. Both girls love people and attention and will seek it out. They are not your typical constant howling Beagles and love the yard they get to play in. Both girls would love to be adopted together and could use a tad bit of weight taken off which we are working on.

My given name is Jasper, but my foster Mom calls me Jazz. I was given my name by the folks at GLWR, when they took me in. I came to the shelter after a kind person picked me up as a stray. I am an energetic, beautiful blue 3-4-year-old male. I am really lucky to have a landed myself a great foster gig and I am really doing well. I know basic commands such as sit, down and come, and I have good recall. I like to play fetch outside, no matter what the weather, and I will release the ball or toy when asked. I like to look for wildlife like squirrels, birds and mailmen from the windows, and I like to relax with a good bone. I am healthy, housebroken, and crate-trained.\n\nI am a very affectionate dog who likes cuddling and curling up on the couch with my people. I play well with other dogs and get along fine with my Weim sister, Murphy.  \n\nBefore I moved into my foster home, I had a habit of hoarding things. That is, I was known to collect items that I thought were valuable and I would hide them in my crate! Since moving into my foster home, I have not exhibited this behavior at all.  However, I do have a tendency to resource guard. I like to be sole owner of my dog crate, and I consider it my personal retreat. Sometimes I bring dog toys in there to keep them safe. When I am in my crate, I do not really want to be bothered. For this reason, it may be best if I go to a home as an only dog and with no young children. It is important that my family is patient with me, and understands resource guarding and is willing to help me evolve beyond my insecurities.\n\nI cannot wait to find a human or two, or more to call my own. I need someone who is willing to continue working with me on obedience, and who can provide plenty of exercise. I have an easy disposition, a fun-loving spirit, and I would really like to meet you!"},"sex":{"$t":"M"},"age":{"$t":"Young"},"size":{"$t":"L"},"mix":{"$t":"no"},"shelterId":{"$t":"MI493"},"lastUpdate":{"$t":"2014-02-03T19:35:25Z"},"media":{"photos":{"photo":[{"@size":"x","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/US/MI/MI493/26747219/MI493.26747219-1-x.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"fpm","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/US/MI/MI493/26747219/MI493.26747219-1-fpm.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"pn","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/US/MI/MI493/26747219/MI493.26747219-1-pn.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"pnt","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/US/MI/MI493/26747219/MI493.26747219-1-pnt.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"t","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/US/MI/MI493/26747219/MI493.26747219-1-t.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"x","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/US/MI/MI493/26747219/MI493.26747219-2-x.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"fpm","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/US/MI/MI493/26747219/MI493.26747219-2-fpm.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"pn","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/US/MI/MI493/26747219/MI493.26747219-2-pn.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"pnt","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/US/MI/MI493/26747219/MI493.26747219-2-pnt.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"t","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/US/MI/MI493/26747219/MI493.26747219-2-t.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"x","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/US/MI/MI493/26747219/MI493.26747219-3-x.jpg","@id":"3"},{"@size":"fpm","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/US/MI/MI493/26747219/MI493.26747219-3-fpm.jpg","@id":"3"},{"@size":"pn","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/US/MI/MI493/26747219/MI493.26747219-3-pn.jpg","@id":"3"},{"@size":"pnt","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/US/MI/MI493/26747219/MI493.26747219-3-pnt.jpg","@id":"3"},{"@size":"t","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/US/MI/MI493/26747219/MI493.26747219-3-t.jpg","@id":"3"}]}},"id":{"$t":"26747219"},"animal":{"$t":"Dog"}},{"options":{"option":[{"$t":"altered"},{"$t":"hasShots"},{"$t":"housebroken"}]},"breeds":{"breed":{"$t":"Chihuahua"}},"shelterPetId":{},"status":{"$t":"A"},"name":{"$t":"Norah"},"contact":{"email":{"$t":"digsk9@gmail.com"},"zip":{"$t":"60540"},"city":{"$t":"Naperville"},"fax":{},"address1":{"$t":"General"},"phone":{},"state":{"$t":"IL"},"address2":{}},"description":{"$t":"Hi!
